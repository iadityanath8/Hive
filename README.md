# Hive Library

Hive is a custom C++ standard library alternative designed to provide a more Python-like experience while maintaining high performance and flexibility. It aims to replace parts of the existing C++ standard library with a fresh, modern, and lightweight approach.

## Features

- **String Class**: A custom string implementation that provides efficient memory management and a user-friendly API.
- **List Class**: A dynamic array-like container with efficient resizing and element access.
- **Generic Print Function**: A Python-like `print` function that supports automatic spacing between arguments.
- **Format Function**: A lightweight, flexible alternative to `printf` that works with `const char*`.
- **Hive Ranges**: A modern approach to iterators, inspired by C++20 ranges but optimized for performance and flexibility.
- **Concepts & Traits for Hash and Iterators**: Provides compile-time constraints for custom hash functions and iterators, ensuring type safety and efficiency.
- **`hive::printf` Function**: A formatted output function that allows easy string formatting, similar to `printf`, but more flexible.

## Goals

- **Minimal Dependency**: Hive does not rely on the C++ standard library (`std`) but utilizes the C standard library (`libc`).
- **Performance-Oriented**: Optimized memory management for speed and efficiency.
- **Python-Like Simplicity**: Inspired by Pythonâ€™s ease of use while retaining the power of C++.
- **Custom Standard Library**: Aiming to replace key C++ standard library components with a custom alternative.

## Installation

To use Hive in your project, simply include the `hive.hpp` header and compile your code with a C++ compiler that supports C++20.

```sh
 g++ --std=c++20 -fno-exceptions -o main main.cc
```

## Usage

### String
```cpp
String s = "Hello, Hive!";
s += " Welcome.";
print(s);
```

### List
```cpp
List<int> numbers = {1, 2, 3, 4};
numbers.push(5);
print(numbers);
```

### Generic Print
```cpp
print("Hive is awesome!", 42, 3.14);
```

### Format
```cpp
String formatted = format("The answer is {}", 42);
print(formatted);
```

### Hive Ranges
```cpp
List<int> numbers = {1, 2, 3, 4, 5};
for (auto x : numbers.range()) {
    print(x);
}
```

### Concepts & Traits for Hash and Iterators
```cpp
template <Hashable T>
struct MyHash {
    size_t operator()(const T& value) const {
        return custom_hash(value);
    }
};
```

### Hive `printf`
```cpp
hive::printf("The result is {}", 23);
```

## Future Work
- Implementing additional data structures (e.g., `Map`, `Set`).
- Expanding the `format` function for more advanced formatting.
- Creating an optimized memory allocator.
- Enhancing Hive Ranges for more complex transformations.
- Further improvements to concepts and traits for hashing and iterators.
